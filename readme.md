**EyeSpeak: Computer Control by Eye Movement**

EyeSpeak is software developed to locate the direction where the eye's pupil is looking, enabling computer control through eye movement. Using advanced techniques in computer vision and image processing, the program captures and analyzes eye movements in real time. Based on the pupil's coordinates, it sends signals to the computer, allowing the user to control the cursor like a conventional mouse.

**Key Features:**

- Precise detection of pupil position using computer vision techniques (OpenCV).
- Integration with Raspberrypy 3 to send control commands based on eye movement to an aplication on a IPAD using MQTT comunication.

This project combines knowledge from electronic engineering and computer vision, showcasing how technology can be applied to provide more accessible and innovative computer interaction.
